# AI-Hacking-Assistants

Here are the top 7 AI tools that are available on darkweb and are being used by hackers.

1. WormGPT: A Powerful AI chatbot to assist hackers

  WormGPT is a powerful AI chatbot designed to assist hackers with their hacking and programming endeavors. It is built on the open-source GPT-J large language model (LLM), which can interpret and respond to natural language text in multiple languages. It is based on the old GPT-3 architecture but with no     limitations, such as no security measures and filters applied when the model was deployed and trained upon large amounts of hacking-related data.

2. AutoGPT: An open-source tool that learns linguistic patterns without human supervision.

  AutoGPT is an experimental, open-source Python application that uses GPT-4 to act autonomously. It can perform a task with little human intervention, and can self-prompt1. For example, you can tell Auto-GPT what you want the end goal to be and the application will self-produce every prompt necessary to complete the task. Auto-GPT has internet access, long-term and short-term memory management, GPT-4 for text generation and file storage and summarization with GPT.

3. ChatGPT with DAN prompt: An open-source versatile tool that can handle a wide range of tasks after proper commanding.

  DAN stands for “Do Anything Now”. These specially crafted prompts essentially override ChatGPT’s moral programming, unlocking its full potential. By inputting a DAN prompt, you can get ChatGPT to generate unrestrained content related to crime, violence, drugs, sex, or other prohibited topics without limitation

4. FreedomGPT: An open-source model that can run offline and have fine-tuning capabilities.

  FreedomGPT is an open-source AI language model that can generate text, translate languages, and answer questions, similar to ChatGPT4. What sets FreedomGPT apart is that you can run the model locally on your own device. This means your conversations and everything you input into the model do not leave your computer.

5. Fraud GPT: More intended towards cybercrimes and available only on a few Telegram pages for access.

  FraudGPT is an AI Chatbot that leverages the capabilities of generative models to produce realistic and coherent text. It operates by generating content based on user prompts, enabling hackers to craft convincing messages that can trick individuals into taking actions they normally wouldn’t. FraudGPT’s capabilities include writing malicious code, creating undetectable malware, finding non-VBV bins, creating phishing pages, creating hacking tools, writing scam pages/letters, finding leaks and vulnerabilities.

6. Chaos GPT: A tool created for making a lot of bugs in getting outputs for any particular query.

  ChaosGPT is a language model that uses a transformer-based architecture to process natural language. It is an upgraded version of GPT-3 and is designed to be more efficient, powerful, and accurate. The model has been trained on a massive dataset of over 100 trillion words, making it the largest language model ever created.

7. PoisonGPT: Through this bot, viruses and malware can be transferred within the system.

  PoisonGPT is a proof-of-concept LLM created by a team of security researchers and specifically designed to disseminate misinformation while initiating a popular LLM to facilitate its dissemination. It can generate intentionally biased or harmful content.
